# Fabio Soggia's Website

Hi! This is my website source code.

This project uses:

* [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* CSS3
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
* [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
* Creativity & Passion


## Can I use this code?

No, you can't. It's open sourse but not free. I'm sorry. Everything
about this website is focused on my personality, my tastes and my feelings.
It's too close to my life to be freely usable by everyone else.

Enjoy the design, get inspired, love it, but do not copy my life please.
